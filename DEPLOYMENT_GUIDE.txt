# 🚀 DEPLOYMENT GUIDE - Fix Your 404 Error

## The Problem
You're seeing a `404: NOT_FOUND` error on Vercel. This usually means:
- Files aren't in the right location
- Vercel can't find your index.html
- Wrong configuration

## ✅ SOLUTION - Deploy These Files

Use the files in the `deploy` folder - they're configured correctly for Vercel.

### Files to Deploy:
```
deploy/
├── index.html      ← Your calculator (MUST BE NAMED index.html)
├── vercel.json     ← Simple config
└── package.json    ← Project info
```

## 🎯 How to Fix and Redeploy

### Option 1: Redeploy via CLI (FASTEST)

```bash
# Navigate to the deploy folder
cd deploy

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod

# Follow the prompts:
# - Link to existing project? YES (select your project)
# - Or create new project? YES
```

### Option 2: Delete and Redeploy via Dashboard

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Delete the broken deployment**:
   - Click on your project
   - Settings → Delete Project
3. **Create New Project**:
   - Click "Add New" → "Project"
   - Drag and drop the **deploy** folder
   - Click "Deploy"

### Option 3: GitHub (Start Fresh)

```bash
# Create a new repo with just the deploy files
cd deploy
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Compressible Flow Calculator"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
git push -u origin main
```

Then connect on Vercel:
- Go to https://vercel.com/new
- Import from GitHub
- Select your repository
- Click "Deploy"

## 🔍 Checklist Before Deploying

- [ ] File is named `index.html` (lowercase, no spaces)
- [ ] All 3 files are in the same folder
- [ ] No files in subfolders
- [ ] You're deploying the root folder containing index.html

## 📱 After Deployment

You should see:
1. ✅ Build: Completed
2. ✅ Preview URL working
3. ✅ Production URL working

Visit your site and test:
- Enter Mach number: 1.5
- Click "Calculate Properties"
- Should see results appear

## ❌ Still Getting 404?

Try **ultra-minimal deployment**:

1. **Deploy ONLY index.html**:
   - Delete vercel.json
   - Delete package.json
   - Deploy only index.html file

2. **Vercel will automatically**:
   - Detect it as static HTML
   - Create the project
   - Deploy successfully

## 💡 Common Mistakes

❌ **Wrong**: Deploying parent folder with index.html inside subfolder
✅ **Right**: Deploying the folder that directly contains index.html

❌ **Wrong**: File named "index (1).html" or "INDEX.html"
✅ **Right**: File named exactly "index.html"

❌ **Wrong**: Uploading .zip file
✅ **Right**: Uploading unzipped folder

## 🎉 Success Looks Like

After successful deployment, you'll see:
```
✓ Production: compressible-flow-calculator.vercel.app
✓ Deployed to production
```

Your calculator will work at:
- `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

## Need More Help?

1. Check Vercel deployment logs in dashboard
2. Look for red error messages
3. Copy error message and search Vercel docs
4. Try the ultra-minimal approach (just index.html)

**Ready?** Go to the `deploy` folder and run `vercel --prod` 🚀
